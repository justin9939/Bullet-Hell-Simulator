# My Personal Project: 
## Windows Fighter x64 

***What will it do?***

My project will be a "bullet-hell" type game focusing mostly on evasion where the player
controls a character with 4-directional movement. Bullets on screen will bounce off the walls.
The player can:
- Manually add hazardous projectiles to the screen
- Avoid projectiles added to the screen, hence the name "bullet hell"
- Manually and permanently (within one game) increase the speed of bullets added for a challenge
- Manually store and use "firewalls," functioning as bombs to clear the screen of projectiles

***Who will use it?***

I intend for this game to be played by everyone who finds it. However, the target 
demographic will be people with backgrounds in computers, as the name of the game 
as well as its content frequently references things to do with computers.

***Why is this project of interest to you?***

When I was young, I enjoyed and was skilled at bullet hell games such as Strikers 1945. 
However, my favorite games, the *"iFighter"* series on mobile devices, were discontinued 
without warning. No other game I played could take iFighter's place, so I eventually 
became distant from the bullet hell genre as a whole. I want to make a game that will 
be able to sharpen both my and others' skills in avoiding projectiles in bullet hell games,
to improve enjoyment of any bullet hell games played in the future. 
I also want to incorporate my Computer Science background into this game, 
to combine two of my favorite things.
