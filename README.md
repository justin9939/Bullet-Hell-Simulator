# My Personal Project: 
## Windows Fighters x64 

***What will it do?***

My project will be a "bullet hell" type game, where the player
controls a character that attacks automatically, on a vertically 
scrolling screen. 
The player must:
- Avoid or destroy enemies that will try to collide with them
- Avoid enemy projectiles, hence the name "bullet hell"
- Destroy the boss enemy at the end of each level

There will be a set number of implemented levels, each with 
a unique pattern of enemies, and a unique boss. As the name is a
pun on the Windows x64 system, the game will be computer 
themed. The player will control an antivirus icon, enemies will be 
things like bugs and errors, and bosses will be viruses.


***Who will use it?***

I intend for this game to be played by everyone who finds it. 
However, the target demographic will be people with backgrounds 
in computers, as the name of the game as well as its content
frequently references things to do with computers.

***Why is this project of interest to you?***

When I was young, I enjoyed and was skilled at bullet hell
games such as Strikers 1945. However, my favorite games, the
*"iFighter"* series on mobile devices, were discontinued without 
warning. No other game I played could take iFighter's place,
so I eventually became distant from the bullet hell genre as a whole. 
I want to make a game that will bring others similar amounts of 
enjoyment that iFighter brought me. I also want to incorporate my
Computer Science background into this game, to combine two of my 
favorite things.
