# My Personal Project: 
## Bullet Hell Simulator
// TODO: update controls image, update game image
***What will it do?***

My project will be a sandbox/simulator, where the player can simulate scenarios common
in most bullet hell games. These scenarios include:
- Enemies firing bullets from the top of the screen
- Changing weapon type
- Collecting upgrades
- Collecting "firewalls" functioning as bombs
- Using firewalls to clear bullets from the screen

***Who will use it?***

I intend for this game to be played by everyone who finds it. However, the target 
demographic will be fans of bullet hell games such as Touhou or Strikers 1945.

***Why is this project of interest to you?***

When I was young, I enjoyed and was skilled at bullet hell games. However, my favorite games 
of this type, the *"iFighter"* series on mobile devices, were discontinued without warning. 
No other game I played could take iFighter's place, so I eventually became distant from the bullet hell 
genre as a whole. No other bullet hell game I've played since was quite like how iFighter was, so I want
to create a simulation that captures the essence of the mechanics of the game, so people like me can easily
relive memories of a discontinued game.
